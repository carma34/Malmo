# Multi-agent competitive games whith Malmo
In this project we have created different multiagent competitive games, in order to use different algorithms to solve them. The Q-learning algorithm has been used to provide automatic learning to agents and to solve games in a simple way. In addition, a fixed strategy algorithm has been developed for each task. You can use this code to improve the algorithms or use another one and perform tests with different agents and algorithms. 

## Collecting items
This game consists of 2 to 4 agents competing to collect the largest number of items. You can see an example whith 2 agents, 'Robot#1' with the closest item strategy and 'Robot#2' using the Q-learnig algorithm, in the video 2agent_collecting_items.mp4

## Conquist
This game consists of 2 to 4 agents competing to paint the most blocks. You can see an example with 2 agents, 'Robot#1' using the Q-learning algorithm and the other one whith scanning moves, in the video 2agent_conquest.mp4

## Predator vs prey
This game consists of two agents with roles predator and prey, which are exchanged every 15 steps. The agent with the sword is the predator and the other the prey.  You can see an example with 2 agents, 'Robot#1' using the Q-learning algorithm and the other one whith the strategy of chasing and fleeing, in the video predator_prey.mp4
